# Assignments
Most of the assignments in this course will be related to your own database and exercises to familiarize you with the systems that we will be using. A second set of assignments will involve the use of an existing database to answer a set of queries, or to modify the database. The same database (called "Diveshop") will be used for the second set of assignments. We will discuss these assignments further in class.

# Workshops
There will be some workshop sessions (graded and ungraded) scheduled for this course. These sessions will help you become more familiar with code and infrastructure.

# Late Policy for Assignments/Workshops
Late submissions, will be penalized 25% a day after the due date.  No exceptions.
